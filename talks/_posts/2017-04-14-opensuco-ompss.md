The OpenSuCo Workshop is a meeting point for the open source hardware,
software, and scientific computing projects community. It looks for a singular
point of technical discussion and exchange.

OmpSs is an effort to integrate features from the StarSs programming model
developed at BSC into a single programming model. In particular, our objective
is to extend OpenMP with new directives to support asynchronous parallelism and
heterogeneity (devices like GPUs). However, it can also be understood as new
directives extending other accelerator based APIs like CUDA or OpenCL. Our
OmpSs environment is built on top of our Mercurium compiler and Nanos++ runtime
system.
