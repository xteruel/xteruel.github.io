The tutorial will motivate the audience on the need for portable, efficient
programming models that put less pressure on program developers while still
getting good performance for clusters and clusters with GPUs.
 

## Contents
More specifically, the tutorial will introduce the hybrid MPI/OmpSs parallel
programming model for future exascale systems and it will demonstrate how to
use MPI/OmpSs to incrementally parallelize/optimize: 1) MPI applications on
clusters of SMPs, and 2) Leverage CUDA kernels with OmpSs on clusters of GPUs

### Prerequisites
* Good knowledge of C/C++
* Basic knowledge of CUDA/OpenCL
* Basic knowledge of Paraver/Extrae

### Learning Outcomes
The students who finish this course will be able to develop benchmarks and
simple applications with the MPI/OmpSs programming model to be executed in
clusters of GPUs.
