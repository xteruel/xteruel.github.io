Facing design issues for task affinity in OpenMP. Exploring and evaluating
several approaches using Nanos++ and LLVM OpenMP runtimes.


## Abstract
OpenMP tasking supports parallelization of irregular algorithms. Recent OpenMP
specifications extended tasking to increase functionality and to support
optimizations, for instance with the taskloop construct. However, task
scheduling remains opaque, which leads to inconsistent performance on NUMA
architectures. We assess design issues for task affinity and explore
several approaches to enable it.

We evaluate  these proposals with implementations in the Nanos++ and LLVM
OpenMP runtimes that improve performance up to 40% and significantly reduce
execution time variation.
