Reducing the performance analysis life-cycle when doing the parallelization of
an application and incorporating data that is only know in the compiler and
runtime side.


## Abstract

Parallelism has become more and more commonplace with the advent of the
multicore processors. Although different parallel programming models have
arisen to exploit the computing capabilities of such processors, developing
applications that take benefit of these processors may not be easy. And what is
worse, the performance achieved by the parallel version of the application may
not be what the developer expected, as a result of a dubious utilization of the
resources offered by the processor.

We present in this paper a fruitful synergy of a shared memory parallel
compiler and runtime, and a performance extraction library. The objective of
this work is not only to reduce the performance analysis life-cycle when doing
the parallelization of an application, but also to extend the analysis
experience of the parallel application by incorporating data that is only known
in the compiler and runtime side. Additionally we present performance results
obtained with the execution of instrumented application and evaluate the
overhead of the instrumentation.
