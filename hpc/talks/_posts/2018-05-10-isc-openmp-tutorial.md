An advanced tutorial using the tasking model of the OpenMP standard. This
course includes recent addition of OpenMP 4.5, being all the lecturers part of
the OpenMP language committee.

With the increasing prevalence of multi-core processors, shared-memory
programming models are essential. OpenMP is a popular, portable, widely
supported and easy-to-use shared-memory model. Since version 3.0 released in
2008, OpenMP offers tasking to support the creation of composable parallel
software blocks and the parallelization of irregular algorithms. Developers
usually find OpenMP easy to learn. However, mastering the tasking concept of
OpenMP requires a change in the way developers reason about the structure of
their code and how to expose the parallelism of it. Our tutorial addresses this
critical aspect by examining the tasking concept in detail and presenting
patterns as solutions to many common problems.

We assume attendees understand basic parallelization concepts and know the
fundamentals of OpenMP. We present the OpenMP tasking language features in
detail and focus on performance aspects, such as introducing cut-off
mechanisms, exploiting task dependencies, and preserving locality. All aspects
are accompanied by extensive case studies. Throughout all topics we present the
recent additions of OpenMP 4.5 and extensions that have been subsequently
adopted by the OpenMP Language Committee.
