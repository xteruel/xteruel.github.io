<p>Welcome to my personal website. My name is Xavier and I am a computer
engineer currently working and living in Barcelona (Spain). I must admit that I
am in love with this city which, by the way, I think is one of the best places
in which you can live from all over the world.</p>
 
<p>The main purpose of these pages is to offer an overview of my professional
profile. I will show a list of my publications, talks (including tutorials,
presentations, demos and other teaching activities), projects and some other
events in which I am involved in because of my job.  All in all, it is a kind
of professional portfolio.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and visiting these pages. I hope that you will find
them interesting.</p>
