Parallel programming course included within the International Summer School on
HPC Challenges in Computational Sciences (2012)


### Contents

The Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe (PRACE) and the Extreme
Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) have collaborated to
offer the third European-U.S. Summer School on HPC Challenges in Computational
Sciences. Goals of the summer school are for attending graduate students and
postdoctoral students to gain greater knowledge about high performance
computing (HPC) and its applications in multiple fields of science and
engineering and to foster new collegial friendships and partnerships among the
international presenters and attendees.
