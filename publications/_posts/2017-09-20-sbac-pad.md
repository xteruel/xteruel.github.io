Presents an extension of the OmpSs framework that solves two main objectives:
the automatic division of datasets among several devices and the management of
their memory address spaces.

### Abstract
Heterogeneous systems have a very high potential performance but present
difficulties in their programming. OmpSs is a well known framework for task
based parallel applications, which is an interesting tool to simplify the
programming of these systems. However, it does not support the co-execution of
a single OpenCL kernel instance on several compute devices. To overcome this
limitation, this paper presents an extension of the OmpSs framework that solves
two main objectives: the automatic division of datasets among several devices
and the management of their memory address spaces. To adapt to different kinds
of applications, the data division can be performed by the novel HGuided load
balancing algorithm or by the well known Static and Dynamic. All this is
accomplished with negligible impact on the programming. Experimental results
reveal that there is always one load balancing algorithm that improves the
performance and energy consumption of the system.
