An extension to the OpenMP task construct to add support for reductions in
while-loops and general-recursive algorithms.


## Abstract

The wide adoption of parallel processing hardware in mainstream computing as
well as the raising interest for efficient parallel programming in the
developer community increase the demand for parallel programming model support
for common algorithmic patterns. In this work we present an extension to the
OpenMP task construct to add support for reductions in while-loops and
general-recursive algorithms. Further we discuss implications on the OpenMP
standard and present a prototype implementation in OmpSs. Benchmark results
confirm applicability of this approach and scalability on current SMP systems.
