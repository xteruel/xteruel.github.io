## Abstract

Tasks are a new feature which will be included in the OpenMP 3.0 future
standard. This new feature will allow exploiting new types of parallelism that
can not be exploited with the current standard such as recursive traversal of
data structures or unbounded loops. A task is defined as a unit of work that
can be deferred and executed as an independent piece of code.

In this paper we describe the experience of extending an existing programming
model environment (the Nano-threads library and the Mercurium compiler) in
order to support this new feature.  Nano-threads library is an OpenMP Run Time
Library (RTL) which gives support to compiler transformations, offering
services such as fork/join, thread synchronization, dependence control, etc.
Mercurium compiler is a source-to-source compiler which translates OpenMP
directives into a sequence of library calls.

This paper is focused on the Nano-threads (Nanos) RTL modifications. We discuss
about the main topics that appear during the implementation process and
different decisions that have been taken in order to implement the new OpenMP
Task specification.
