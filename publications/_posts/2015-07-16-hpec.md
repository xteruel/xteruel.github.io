## Abstract

Array-type reductions represent a frequently occurring algorithmic pattern in
many scientific applications. A special case occurs if array elements are
accessed in an irregular, often random manner, making their concurrent and
scalable execution difficult. In this work we present a new approach that
consists of language and runtime support and targets popular parallel
programming models such as OpenMP. Its runtime support implements Privatization
with In-lined, Block-Ordered Reductions (PIBOR), a new approach that trades
processor cycles to increase locality and bandwidth efficiency for such
algorithms. A reference implementation in OmpSs, a task-parallel programming
model, shows promising results on current multicore systems.
