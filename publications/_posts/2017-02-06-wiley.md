Discussion about some desirables features of future programming models when
programming on top of hybrid and heterogenous architectures.

###Abstract
Multicore architectures alleviate several problems that are related to
single-core processors but at the same time raise the programmability wall:
experienced application developers find it hard to extract reasonable
performance from shared memory homogeneous multicore architectures, and the
situation is even worse when considering heterogeneous multicore architectures,
distributed memories and explicitly managed memory hierarchies. In order to
overcome the new programming challenges, programming models need to evolve to
include features that offer a simple and portable path to migrate applications
to homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures.
