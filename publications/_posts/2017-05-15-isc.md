Presenting the Resource Manager through the definition of its different APIs:
Offloading, Resource Enforcement, Pause/Resume and Dynamic Resource Sharing.

## Abstract

The Resource Manager framework is composed of four different APIs, divided in
two groups. On the one hand, Native/OpenCL Offload and Resource Enforcement
(RE) APIs are designed to be directly used by application or library
developers. On the other hand, Task Resume/Pause and Dynamic Resource Sharing
(DRS) APIs are designed to be used directly by parallel runtimes and
communication libraries.
