Generalizes the concept of array privatization to support a variety of array
reduction techniques, implements an inspector-executor to provide memory access
analytics to the runtime for automatic tuning and shows what language
extensions are needed.


### Abstract
Irregular array-type reductions represent a reoccurring algorithmic pattern in
many scientific applications. Their scalable execution on modern systems is not
trivial as their irregular memory access pattern prohibits an efficient use of
the memory subsystem and costly techniques are needed to eliminate data races.
Taking a closer look at algorithms, memory access patterns and support
techniques reveals that a one-size-fits-all solution does not exist and
approaches are needed that can adapt to individual properties while maintaining
programming transparency. In this work we propose a solution framework that
generalizes the concept of privatization to support a variety of techniques,
implements an inspector-executor to provide memory access analytics to the
runtime for automatic tuning and shows what language extensions are needed. A
reference implementation in OmpSs, a task-parallel programming model, shows
programmability and scalability of this solution.
