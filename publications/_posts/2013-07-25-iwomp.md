Proposing a new construct to enable the distribution of a loop when executing in
the context of an explicit task, a single or master construct.


## Abstract

With the addition of the OpenMP* tasking model, programmers are able to improve
and extend the parallelization opportunities of their codes. Programmers can
also distribute the creation of tasks using a worksharing construct, which
allows the generation of work to be parallelized. However, while it is possible
to create tasks inside worksharing constructs, it is not possible to distribute
work when not all threads reach the same worksharing construct. We propose a
new worksharing-like construct that removes this restriction: the taskloop
construct. With this new construct, we can distribute work when executing in
the context of an explicit task, a single, or a master construct, enabling us
to explore new parallelization opportunities in our applications. Although we
focus our current work on evaluating expressiveness rather than performance
evaluation, we present some initial performance results using a naive
implementation for the new taskloop construct based on a lazy task
instantiation mechanism.
