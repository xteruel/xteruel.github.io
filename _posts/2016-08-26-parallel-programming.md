## Contents

The objectives of this course are to understand the fundamental concepts
supporting message-passing and shared memory programming models. The course
covers the two widely used programming models: MPI for the distributed-memory
environments, and OpenMP for the shared-memory architectures. It also presents
the main tools developed at BSC to get information and analyze the execution of
parallel applications, Paraver and Extrae. Moreover it sets the basic
foundations related with task decomposition and parallelization inhibitors,
using a tool to analyze potential parallelism and dependences, Tareador.
